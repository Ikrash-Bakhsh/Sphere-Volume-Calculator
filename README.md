# Sphere-Volume-Calculator
This C++ program calculates the volume of a sphere based on user-inputted radius. The formula used is V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where 'r' is the radius and 'π' is a predefined constant (3.141).

Usage: Users can input the radius of the sphere, and the program will output the corresponding volume. The program utilizes a simple console interface for user interaction.
